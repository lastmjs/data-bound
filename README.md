# data-bound
Standalone data binding for web components

## Deprecated

While I was working on this library, I came across a couple of other similar projects:

* https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html
* https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML

I prefer lit-html, and it essentially is everything I wanted this library to be. This library is deprecated in favor of lit-html.
